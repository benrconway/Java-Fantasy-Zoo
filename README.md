# Monster's Playground
## A Fantasy Zoo Manager Application.
### Written in Java and intended to become an Android Game.

Goal: Practice OO modelling  in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our dragons, unicorns and other mystical beings. 

#### MVP

The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

#### Project Extensions
 
* Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other. 
* Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/
* Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left. 
* View the total income for the zoo.
* Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures

In this project it was my goal to solidify my understanding of Java and object oriented programming. If I managed that
it was in my mind to expand the code to become the base of an interactive Android game.

I managed to achieve the MVP and most of the extensions (I didn't feel that the Fantasy Zoo at this point would want to sell
Animal babies and my rampage is a bit contrived along with the basic terminal interface for playing it). I found myself at this point of experience refactoring my code without a clear goal and sometimes making it harder to understand as I moved further down the rabbit hole.

In the future I hope to revisit this application code, at which point I'll need to:
- Refresh my understanding of what the code is doing
- Plan the changes to my code to bring it in line with an android game
- Plan extensions in the code for what I want the game to be able to do
- Execute sprints to achieve functionality with plenty of space for reflection and user testing.
